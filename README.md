# Hi, I'm Gaurav 

My specialty lies in the crafting highly interactive experiences for the web and mobile platform. I provide progressive art direction, design and programming services for design firm, advertising agencies and business looking to create memorable experiences that create and reinforce brand recognition.

Ideas are my bread n butter. I mold and shape them into living breathing interactive experiences and captivate. I believe that great interactive ideas drive on the tension between design and code.

Since 1998's, I’ve been fortunate to be involved in a variety of projects — from developing desktop application in Visual Basic, Foxpro, web based using Java, Python, ASP, PHP to mobile application using Java,Swift and now React Native. While I still like to get my hands dirty, my work is focused on research, strategy, addressing organizational challenges and helping other developer do the work.
